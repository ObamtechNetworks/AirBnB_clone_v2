# 0x04. AirBnB clone - Web framework

This project is an implementation of an AirBnB clone using Flask, a Python web framework. The primary objective is to develop a back-end web server utilizing Flask to handle routing, rendering templates, and interacting with a MySQL database to display data dynamically on HTML templates.
